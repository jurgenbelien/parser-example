# Writing a parser in Nearley

How to write a parser in Nearley by parsing a game of Noughts and Crosses.

Consider this game board:
```
X _ _
_ O _
_ _ _

```

It shows 3 rows of 3 cells. One Cross `X` has been played, as well as one Nought `O`.
The rest of the cells are identified by an underscore  `_`.
